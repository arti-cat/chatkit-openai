## What's Partially Covered ⚠️

### 5. MCP Integration (40% Coverage)

**What IS Covered:**
- ⚠️  MCP tools are referenced throughout (azure, context7, playwright, sequential-thinking)
- ⚠️  Some agents use MCP tools in their tool lists

**What IS NOT Covered:**
- ❌ What MCP is and how it differs from standard tools
- ❌ How to configure MCP servers
- ❌ MCP server discovery and setup
- ❌ Custom MCP server development
- ❌ MCP authentication and security
- ❌ Troubleshooting MCP connections
- ❌ MCP vs plugin system distinction

**Impact:** HIGH - MCP is extensively used in the codebase but not explained in documentation.

**Recommendation:**
Add a dedicated section: **"6. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration"**

```markdown
## 6. MCP Server Integration

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol enables Claude Code to integrate with external tools and services beyond built-in capabilities.

### Current MCP Servers in Use
1. **context7** - Library documentation retrieval
   - `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`
   - `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`

2. **azure** - Azure cloud operations
   - `mcp__azure__list_resources`
   - `mcp__azure__execute_cli_command`

3. **sequential-thinking** - Extended reasoning
   - `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`

4. **playwright** - Browser automation
   - `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
   - `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`

### Configuration
MCP servers configured in:
- Global: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Project: `.claude/settings.json`
- Checked-in: `.mcp.json`

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@context7/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Best Practices
1. Document required MCP servers in CLAUDE.md
2. Use official MCP servers from verified sources
3. Test MCP connectivity before relying on tools
4. Handle MCP failures gracefully in agents
5. Prefer built-in tools over MCP when available
```

- ❌ When and how to create checkpoints
- ❌ Checkpoint recovery and restoration
- ❌ Memory persistence across sessions
- ❌ Memory quotas and limitations
- ❌ Memory search and retrieval APIs
- ❌ Best practices for long-running projects

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Memory management is critical for complex projects but undocumented.

**Recommendation:**
Add section: **"7. Memory Management & Checkpointing"**

```markdown
## 7. Memory Management & Checkpointing

### Memory Types
1. **Session Memory** - Current conversation only
2. **Project Memory** - Persisted across project sessions
3. **Organization Memory** - Shared across team (enterprise)

### Checkpointing Strategy
Create checkpoints at:
- ✅ Before major refactorings
- ✅ After completing milestones
- ✅ Before switching contexts (feature branches)
- ✅ At end of each work session

### Commands
- `/memory:checkpoint` - Create named checkpoint
- `/memory:restore` - Restore from checkpoint
- `/memory:list` - List available checkpoints
- `/memory:clean` - Remove old checkpoints

### ChatKit Project Best Practices
```bash
# Before adding new ChatKit tool
/memory:checkpoint "pre-tool-addition-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# After completing backend implementation
/memory:checkpoint "backend-complete-user-profile-tool"

# Before frontend integration
/memory:checkpoint "pre-frontend-integration"
```
```

---

## What's NOT Covered ❌

### 8. Plan Mode (0% Coverage)

**Missing Documentation:**
- What plan mode is and when to use it
- How to activate plan mode explicitly
- Planning workflow for complex tasks
- Integration with agent routing
- Plan approval and modification
- Exit plan mode protocol

**Impact:** HIGH - Plan mode is a core Claude Code feature for safety and complex tasks.

**Official Guidance (from anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):**
> **Explore → Plan → Code → Commit**:
> 1. Ask Claude to read files without writing code initially
> 2. Request a plan using "think" (or "think harder" for more computation)
> 3. Implement the solution
> 4. Commit and create pull requests

**Recommendation:**
Add major section: **"8. Plan Mode & Safe Code Changes"**

```markdown
## 8. Plan Mode & Safe Code Changes

### What is Plan Mode?
Plan mode allows Claude to analyze complex tasks and create a detailed plan BEFORE making changes. This is critical for:
- Large refactorings
- Architecture changes
- Multi-file modifications
- Security-sensitive updates

### When to Use Plan Mode
✅ **Use plan mode for:**
- Adding features spanning 5+ files
- Refactoring core architecture
- Database schema migrations
- Security or performance optimizations
- Unfamiliar codebase changes

❌ **Don't need plan mode for:**
- Single file edits
- Bug fixes in isolated functions
- Documentation updates
- Test additions

### How to Activate
```bash
# Explicit planning request
"Create a plan for adding user authentication to the ChatKit app"

# Extended thinking with planning
"think harder about how to optimize the ChatKit widget rendering pipeline"

# Plan mode workflow
User: "Plan out adding real-time notifications to ChatKit"
Claude: [Creates detailed plan with agent routing]
User: "Looks good, proceed"
Claude: [Executes plan with specified agents]
```

### Best Practices
1. **Review the plan** - Don't auto-approve complex plans
2. **Ask questions** - Clarify ambiguous steps before execution
3. **Modify incrementally** - Adjust plan if requirements change
4. **Track with todos** - Use TodoWrite to monitor plan execution

### ChatKit Example
```bash
User: "Plan adding a file upload widget to ChatKit"

Claude creates plan:
1. Backend: Add @function_tool for file upload
2. Backend: Create FileUploadWidget renderer
3. Backend: Add file storage (local or S3)
4. Frontend: Handle file upload in onClientToolCall
5. Frontend: Add FileUploader component
6. Testing: Add upload/download tests
7. Docs: Update README with file upload example

User: "Approved, but use S3 for storage instead of local"

Claude: [Executes modified plan with s3-specialist agent]
```
```

---

### 9. Plugin System (0% Coverage)

**Missing Documentation:**
- What plugins are vs skills vs agents
- Plugin architecture and lifecycle
- Plugin discovery mechanisms
- Custom plugin development
- Plugin marketplace usage
- Plugin versioning and updates

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Plugins extend capabilities but aren't documented.

**Recommendation:**
Add section: **"9. Plugin System vs Skills vs Agents"**

```markdown
## 9. Understanding Plugins, Skills, and Agents

### Conceptual Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           PLUGINS (Ecosystem)           │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │      SKILLS (Reusable Workflows) │   │
│  │  ┌──────────────────────────┐   │   │
│  │  │   AGENTS (Task Executors)│   │   │
│  │  └──────────────────────────┘   │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When to Use Each

**Agents** - Single-purpose task executors
- Example: code-reviewer, chatkit-server-expert
- Scope: One specific domain or technology
- Invocation: Automatic via description triggers

**Skills** - Multi-step workflows with scripts
- Example: cloudflare-manager, linear-todo-sync
- Scope: Complete workflows (deploy, sync, generate)
- Invocation: Manual via Skill tool

**Plugins** - Third-party extensions
- Example: PR review toolkit, testing framework
- Scope: Collections of agents + commands + skills
- Invocation: Installed from marketplace

### Plugin Discovery
```bash
# List available plugins
/plugins list

# Search marketplace
/plugins search "testing"

# Install plugin
/plugins install pr-review-toolkit

# Configure plugin
.claude/plugins/pr-review-toolkit/config.json
```

### Creating Custom Plugins
Structure:
```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Metadata
├── agents/
│   └── my-agent.md
├── commands/
│   └── my-command.md
├── skills/
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── hooks/
    └── hooks.json
```
```

### 10. Output Styles (0% Coverage)

**Missing Documentation:**
- Custom output formatting
- Template syntax for structured outputs
- Widget styling beyond ChatKit
- Markdown/HTML formatting directives
- Output format negotiation

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - Nice to have for consistent formatting.

**Recommendation:**
Add section: **"10. Output Styles & Formatting"**

```markdown
## 10. Output Styles & Custom Formatting

### Built-in Output Formats
Claude Code supports multiple output styles:

**Markdown** (default)
```markdown
# Heading
**Bold** _italic_
- List item
```

**Structured JSON**
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "issues": [],
    "recommendations": []
  }
}
```

**Code Blocks**
```python
def example():
    pass
```

### Custom Output Templates
Define consistent formats for agent outputs:

**Code Review Template**
```markdown
## Code Review: {filename}

### Critical Issues (P0)
- [ ] Issue description [line]

### Important Issues (P1)
- [ ] Issue description [line]

### Suggestions (P2)
- [ ] Suggestion [line]

### Strengths
- What's well done

### Score: {score}/10
```

### ChatKit Widget Styling
See [backend/app/sample_widget.py](../../backend/app/sample_widget.py) for widget structure.
```

---

### 11. Extended Thinking (5% Coverage)

**What IS Covered:**
- ⚠️  Sequential-thinking MCP tool is referenced in some agents
- ⚠️  WFGY reasoning agents use advanced logic

**What IS NOT Covered:**
- ❌ "think", "think harder", "think hardest" commands
- ❌ When to use extended thinking vs regular inference
- ❌ Token cost implications of extended thinking
- ❌ Extended thinking for complex architectural decisions
- ❌ Best practices for reasoning-intensive tasks

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Extended thinking is powerful but undocumented.

**Official Guidance (from best practices):**
> Extended thinking ("think" vs. "think hard" vs. "think harder") allocates progressively more computation budget

**Recommendation:**
Add section: **"11. Extended Thinking & Complex Reasoning"**

```markdown
## 11. Extended Thinking & Complex Reasoning

### Thinking Levels

| Command | Computation | Best For | Token Cost |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| (normal) | Standard | Routine tasks | 1x |
| `think` | Extended | Complex analysis | 2-3x |
| `think harder` | Deep | Architecture decisions | 4-6x |
| `think hardest` | Maximum | Research & discovery | 8-10x |

### When to Use Extended Thinking

✅ **Use extended thinking for:**
- Architectural design decisions
- Security vulnerability analysis
- Performance optimization strategies
- Complex debugging (intermittent failures)
- Technology selection (React vs Vue)
- Refactoring strategies for legacy code

❌ **Don't waste tokens on:**
- Simple bug fixes
- Code formatting
- Documentation updates
- Straightforward feature additions

### Usage Examples

**Architecture Decision**
```bash
User: "think harder about whether we should use microservices or monolith for this ChatKit backend"

Claude: [Analyzes trade-offs deeply]
- Considers team size
- Evaluates deployment complexity
- Assesses scaling requirements
- Weighs development velocity
- Recommends approach with rationale
```

**Performance Optimization**
```bash
User: "think about optimizing ChatKit widget rendering performance"

Claude: [Extended analysis]
- Profiles current rendering
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Proposes optimization strategies
- Estimates impact of each
```

### Integration with MCP
The `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool provides:
- Multi-step reasoning chains
- Explicit logic validation
- Hypothesis testing
- Contradiction detection

### Best Practices
1. **Be specific** - "think about X" not just "think"
2. **Use for decisions** - Not for routine implementation
3. **Review output** - Extended thinking provides reasoning, verify conclusions
4. **Budget tokens** - Save extended thinking for high-value problems
```

### 12. Headless Mode (0% Coverage)

**Missing Documentation:**
- `-p` flag usage for programmatic access
- Headless mode for CI/CD
- Python/JavaScript SDK integration
- Output formatting for automation
- Session management in headless context
- Error handling in scripts

**Impact:** HIGH - Critical for automation and CI/CD but completely undocumented.

**Official Guidance (from best practices):**
> **Headless Mode**: Use `-p` flag with prompts for CI/CD integration, issue triage automation, and linting workflows. Output as stream-json for processing pipelines.

**Recommendation:**
Add major section: **"12. Headless Mode & Automation"**

```markdown
## 12. Headless Mode & CI/CD Integration

### What is Headless Mode?
Headless mode allows Claude Code to run non-interactively for:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated code reviews
- Scheduled maintenance tasks
- Batch processing

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Single prompt execution
claude -p "Review the latest commit for security issues"

# With specific agent
claude -p "/security:audit the authentication module"

# Output as JSON for parsing
claude -p --format stream-json "Run all tests and report failures"
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Example**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-review.yml
name: Claude Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Claude Code Review
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          claude -p "Review this PR for security issues and code quality. Output as markdown report." > review.md

      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');
            const review = fs.readFileSync('review.md', 'utf8');
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: review
            });
```

**GitLab CI Example**
```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
claude-review:
  stage: test
  script:
    - claude -p "/code-auditor analyze recent changes"
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: claude-report.json
```

### ChatKit Deployment Automation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-chatkit.sh

set -e

# Validate configuration
claude -p "/chatkit:validate-config" || {
  echo "Configuration validation failed"
  exit 1
}

# Run tests
claude -p "Run all backend tests with coverage report"

# Deploy backend
cd backend
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &

# Deploy frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run build
npm run preview &

# Health check
claude -p "Verify ChatKit endpoints are responding correctly"

echo "Deployment complete"
```

### Best Practices
1. **Set timeouts** - Prevent hanging in CI/CD
2. **Capture output** - Use `--format stream-json` for parsing
3. **Handle errors** - Check exit codes in scripts
4. **Use specific prompts** - Avoid ambiguous requests
5. **Limit scope** - Headless mode for focused tasks only
```
