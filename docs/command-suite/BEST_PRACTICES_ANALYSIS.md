# .claude/ Directory Analysis: Best Practices vs Official Documentation

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-24
**Project:** chatkit-openai
**Analyzed Against:** Official Claude Code documentation (from `~/.claude/commands/.claude-code-docs/`)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CORRECTION NOTICE

**This document was originally written with incorrect guidance about agent descriptions that has now been corrected.**

### What Was Wrong:
- Recommended XML-style examples with `<example>`, `<commentary>` tags
- Suggested user/assistant dialogue format
- Based on community patterns NOT official Claude Code format

### What Is Correct (per official docs):
- Agent descriptions must be **natural language** (no XML tags)
- Use **third-person perspective** ("Expert in..." not "I am...")
- Focus on **trigger phrases** like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED"
- Keep descriptions **concise and action-oriented**

**All sections below have been corrected to match official Claude Code documentation.**

---

## Executive Summary

The `.claude/` directory in this project contains an extensive and well-organized collection of 131 agents, 193 commands, 2 skills, and a hooks system. This analysis compares the current implementation against **official Claude Code documentation** to identify strengths, gaps, and optimization opportunities.

**Overall Assessment:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5 stars)
- Strong agent organization and comprehensive coverage
- Well-structured command namespacing
- Opportunities for improvement in agent descriptions and trigger keywords

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wfgy/            # 9 advanced reasoning agents
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ external/        # 44+ community agents
```

**‚úÖ What's Working Well:**

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - `README.md` with 400+ lines of workflow patterns
   - `WORKFLOW_EXAMPLES.md` for chaining examples
   - `TASK-STATUS-PROTOCOL.md` for task tracking
   - Clear categorization by domain

2. **Agent Diversity**
   - Covers all major development domains
   - Framework-specific experts (React, Next.js, Svelte, Django, Laravel)
   - Advanced reasoning system (WFGY)
   - External community integration

3. **File Organization**
   - Logical grouping by responsibility
   - Easy to navigate and discover agents
   - Clear naming conventions

### üî∂ Gaps & Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Agent Description Format (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current Issue:** Agent descriptions may lack clear trigger keywords that help Claude Code automatically delegate tasks.

**Correct Format from Official Docs:**
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
```

**Key Rules (from official documentation):**
1. **Natural language only** - No XML tags, no dialogue examples
2. **Third-person perspective** - "Expert in..." not "I am..."
3. **Include trigger phrases** - "use PROACTIVELY", "MUST BE USED", "Use immediately when..."
4. **Describe capabilities and scenarios** - What it does + when to use it
5. **Keep it concise** - Focus on the essential information

**Real Examples from Official Claude Code Docs:**

‚úÖ **Correct - Code Reviewer:**
```yaml
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
```

‚úÖ **Correct - Debugger:**
```yaml
description: Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior. Use proactively when encountering any issues.
```

‚úÖ **Correct - Data Scientist:**
```yaml
description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
```

‚ùå **Incorrect - XML Style (DO NOT USE):**
```yaml
description: |
  Expert in code review.

  Examples:
  - <example>
    user: "Review my code"
    assistant: "I'll use @code-reviewer"
  </example>
```

**Recommendation:**
- Audit all 131 agents for description clarity and trigger keywords
- Ensure descriptions follow natural language format (no XML)
- Add phrases like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" where appropriate
- Focus on when/why to invoke the agent, not how it works internally

#### 2. Tool Restrictions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Best Practice:** Most agents should omit the `tools` field to inherit all tools, unless there's a security/safety reason for restriction.

**When to Restrict Tools:**
```yaml
# Security-sensitive agents (read-only)
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code without making changes
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash  # No Write or Edit
---

# Read-only exploration
---
name: code-archaeologist
description: Explores legacy codebases
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash  # No modification tools
---
```

**Recommendation:**
- Review all agents to identify unnecessary tool restrictions
- Only restrict tools for:
  - Security auditors (read-only)
  - Code reviewers (no modifications)
  - Exploratory agents (discovery only)
- Most development agents should have full tool access

#### 3. Agent Auto-Triggering Keywords (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Best Practice:** Use specific trigger phrases in descriptions:
- "MUST BE USED" - Mandatory usage in specific contexts
- "use PROACTIVELY" - Encourage proactive invocation
- "Use IMMEDIATELY" - Urgent/critical scenarios

**Example from Docs:**
```yaml
name: incident-responder
description: MUST BE USED IMMEDIATELY when production issues occur. Battle-tested incident commander for critical outages.
```

**Recommendation:**
- Audit agent descriptions for trigger keywords
- Add "MUST BE USED" to critical agents (security, incident, deployment)
- Add "use PROACTIVELY" to quality/testing agents
- Ensure consistency across similar agent types

#### 4. Agent Coordination Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Best Practice from Awesome Claude Agents:**

**Tech-Lead Orchestrator Pattern:**
```markdown
User: "Build a user management system"

Main Claude:
1. Use tech-lead-orchestrator to analyze and create Agent Routing Map
2. Tech-lead returns specific agents to use for each task
3. Execute ONLY the agents listed in the routing map
4. Use TodoWrite to track progress through the plan
```

**Current Gap:** No explicit tech-lead orchestrator or agent-organizer in the core set.

**Recommendation:**
- Promote the existing `agent-organizer` to a more prominent role
- Create clear workflows showing when to use orchestration
- Add examples of Agent Routing Maps to documentation
- Emphasize the importance of using specified agents (not generic ones)

---

## 2. Command System Analysis

### Current Implementation ‚úì Strengths

**Command Organization:**
```
.claude/commands/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /svelte:*         (15 commands) - Svelte/SvelteKit
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Additional namespaces...
```

**‚úÖ What's Working Well:**

1. **Semantic Namespacing**
   - Clear domain separation
   - Easy to discover related commands
   - Intuitive naming conventions
   - 44,197 lines of comprehensive documentation

2. **Command Completeness**
   - Each namespace has comprehensive README
   - Commands include examples, best practices, troubleshooting
   - Tool declarations are explicit
   - Progressive disclosure of information

3. **Framework-Specific Support**
   - Dedicated Svelte namespace (15 commands)
   - Testing commands cover multiple frameworks
   - Deployment commands for various platforms

### üî∂ Gaps & Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Multi-Role Command Pattern (NEW OPPORTUNITY)

**Best Practice from Claude Code Cookbook:**

```bash
# Multi-role analysis for complex scenarios
/multi-role security,performance [--agent|-a] [analysis_target]

# Examples:
/multi-role security,performance
"Evaluate this API endpoint"

# Parallel execution with sub-agents
/multi-role security,performance --agent
"Comprehensively analyze system security and performance"

# Three-way analysis
/multi-role architect,security,performance --agent
"Evaluate microservices design"
```

**Benefits:**
- Combines perspectives from multiple roles
- Parallel execution with `--agent` flag
- 50-65% time reduction for multi-role analysis
- Integrated insights rather than sequential reviews

**Recommendation:**
- Create `/multi-role` command in `.claude/commands/`
- Support comma-separated role lists
- Implement `--agent` flag for parallel sub-agent execution
- Add effective role combinations to documentation:
  - Security-centric: `security,architect`, `security,frontend`
  - Performance-centric: `performance,architect`, `performance,frontend`
  - UX-centric: `frontend,mobile`, `frontend,performance`
  - Comprehensive: `architect,security,performance`

#### 2. Role Debate Command (NEW OPPORTUNITY)

**Best Practice from Claude Code Cookbook:**

```bash
# Debate opposing perspectives
/role-debate security,performance
"JWT Token Expiry Setting"

/role-debate frontend,security
"2-Factor Authentication UX Optimization"

/role-debate architect,mobile
"React Native vs Flutter Selection"

# Three-party debate
/role-debate architect,security,performance
"Pros and Cons of Microservices"
```

**Benefits:**
- Surfaces trade-offs explicitly
- Considers multiple perspectives
- Helps with complex architectural decisions
- Documents pros/cons for future reference

**Recommendation:**
- Create `/role-debate` command
- Support 2-4 role participants
- Structure output to show each role's perspective
- Include synthesis/recommendation at the end

#### 3. Role Help Command (NEW OPPORTUNITY)

**Best Practice from Claude Code Cookbook:**

```bash
# Get suggestions for role selection
/role-help "API is slow and security is also a concern"
‚Üí Propose appropriate approach (multi-role or debate)

# Compare roles
/role-help compare frontend,mobile
‚Üí Differences and appropriate usage between roles
```

**Recommendation:**
- Create `/role-help` command
- Implement intelligent role suggestions
- Support role comparison functionality
- Help users discover the right agent for their task

#### 4. Command Examples Standardization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Best Practice:** Every command should include:
- Clear prerequisites
- Multiple usage examples
- Expected output format
- Best practices section
- Common issues & troubleshooting

**Current Gap:** Some commands may lack comprehensive examples.

**Recommendation:**
- Audit all 193 commands for example completeness
- Use the `COMMAND_TEMPLATE.md` pattern consistently
- Add real-world scenarios for each command
- Include "when to use vs when not to use" guidance

   - Integration with external services (Cloudflare, Linear)

### üî∂ Gaps & Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Skill Templates (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State:** The `.claude/commands/skills:templates:*` commands exist but may not be as prominent.

**Best Practice:** Provide clear skill templates for common patterns:
- Simple skill template (single file, minimal dependencies)
- Multi-file skill template (complex workflows)
- Tool-restricted skill template (security-sensitive operations)
- Enhanced templates with validation and error handling

**Recommendation:**
- Elevate skill templates in documentation
- Create a `SKILL_CREATION_GUIDE.md` in `.claude/skills/`
- Add examples showing:
  - How to convert a workflow into a skill
  - When to use skills vs commands vs agents
  - Best practices for skill naming and organization

#### 2. Skill Discovery (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current Gap:** Skills are invoked via the `Skill` tool, but discovery could be improved.

**Best Practice from Docs:**
```bash
# Skills should have clear trigger descriptions
<skill>
<name>cloudflare-manager</name>
<description>
Comprehensive Cloudflare account management for deploying Workers, KV Storage, R2, Pages, DNS, and Routes.
Use when deploying cloudflare services, managing worker containers, configuring KV/R2 storage, or setting up DNS/routing.
</description>
</skill>
```

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure all skills have trigger-rich descriptions

## 4. Hooks System Analysis

### Current Implementation ‚úì Strengths

**Hook Collections:**
- 5 hook collection files
- 9 validation scripts
- 5 configuration examples
- Comprehensive README.md

**‚úÖ What's Working Well:**

1. **Validation Coverage**
   - bash-validator
   - component-analyzer
   - format-and-lint
   - story-sync-check
   - svelte-validator
   - typescript-check
   - test-runner
   - bundle-size-check
   - prompt-enhancer

2. **Configuration Examples**
   - Minimal configuration
   - Comprehensive setup
   - Performance-focused
   - Storybook integration
   - Team collaboration

### üî∂ Gaps & Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Hook Configuration in Official Format (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Best Practice from Official Docs:**

**hooks.json format:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 /path/to/validator.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npm run lint"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Validation Script Format:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys

def main():
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)

    if input_data.get("tool_name") != "Bash":
        sys.exit(0)  # Pass through

    command = input_data.get("tool_input", {}).get("command", "")

    # Validation logic
    issues = validate_command(command)

    if issues:
        for message in issues:
            print(f"‚Ä¢ {message}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(2)  # Block tool call

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Hook passed, continue
- `1`: Hook failed, show stderr but continue
- `2`: Block tool call, show stderr

**Recommendation:**
- Update hook scripts to use official stdin/stdout format
- Standardize exit codes (0=pass, 1=warn, 2=block)
- Create `.claude/hooks/hooks.json` configuration file
- Document hook triggering and debugging

#### 2. ChatKit-Specific Hooks (NEW OPPORTUNITY)

**Recommended Hooks for This Project:**

1. **Pre-Commit Hook**
   ```json
   {
     "matcher": "Bash",
     "hooks": [{
       "type": "command",
       "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/validate-chatkit-config.py"
     }]
   }
   ```
   - Validate OPENAI_API_KEY is set
   - Check ChatKit domain key format
   - Verify backend/frontend ports don't conflict

2. **Post-Edit Hook for Python**
   ```json
   {
     "matcher": "Edit",
     "hooks": [{
       "type": "command",
       "command": "sh -c 'if echo \"$FILE\" | grep -q \".py$\"; then cd backend && uv run ruff check \"$FILE\" && uv run mypy \"$FILE\"; fi'"
     }]
   }
   ```
   - Auto-run ruff linting
   - Type check with mypy
   - Only for .py files in backend/

3. **Pre-Deploy Validation**
   ```json
   {
     "matcher": "Bash",
     "hooks": [{
       "type": "command",
       "command": ".claude/hooks/pre-deploy-check.sh"
     }]
   }
   ```
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Check environment variables
   - Validate ChatKit configuration
   - Ensure domain is allowlisted

#### 3. Hook Documentation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current Gap:** May lack clear guidance on:
- When to use PreToolUse vs PostToolUse
- How to debug failing hooks
- Best practices for hook performance
- How to disable hooks temporarily

**Recommendation:**
- Create `HOOKS_GUIDE.md` in `.claude/hooks/`
- Document common hook patterns
- Add troubleshooting section
- Include performance guidelines (hooks should be fast)

```markdown
# Add ChatKit Agent Tool

1. Identify tool type:
   - Widget tool (renders UI)
   - Client tool (triggers frontend action)
   - Data tool (returns data only)

2. Backend implementation:
   - Create @function_tool in backend/app/chat.py
   - Add to assistant tools list
   - Test with server restart

3. Frontend integration (if client tool):
   - Add handler in onClientToolCall
   - Update UI components

4. Testing:
   - Manual test via chat interface
   - Add unit tests if applicable
```

**`/chatkit:add-example`** - Create new example app
```markdown
# Create New ChatKit Example

Based on the three existing examples, scaffold a new example application with:
- Backend FastAPI server with custom port
- Frontend Vite app with custom port
- package.json with npm start script
- README with setup instructions
- Custom agent instructions in backend/app/constants.py
- Example tools and widgets
```

**`/chatkit:validate-config`** - Validate ChatKit configuration
```markdown
# Validate ChatKit Configuration

Check:
1. Environment variables set (OPENAI_API_KEY, VITE_CHATKIT_API_DOMAIN_KEY)
2. Domain allowlisting configured (vite.config.ts)
3. Backend/frontend ports don't conflict
4. Proxy configuration is correct

```markdown
# Add Full-Stack ChatKit Feature

## Task
Add a complete feature spanning backend tools, widgets, and frontend handlers.

## Workflow
1. Use agent-organizer to plan the feature
2. Use chatkit-server-expert to implement backend tool
3. Use chatkit-frontend-expert to add frontend handler
4. Use test-engineer to add tests
5. Use documentation-expert to update docs

## Example
User: "Add a user profile lookup tool that shows a widget with user details"

Plan:
1. Backend: Create @function_tool get_user_profile()
2. Backend: Create UserProfileWidget renderer
3. Frontend: No client tool needed (widget-only)
4. Test: Add test for API call and widget rendering
5. Docs: Update README with usage example
```

## 9. Conclusion

The current `.claude/` directory is already well-organized and comprehensive. The recommendations in this analysis focus on:

1. **Alignment with Official Claude Code Documentation** - Natural language descriptions, standardized hooks, proper trigger phrases
2. **Community Best Practices** - Multi-role commands, role debates, tech-lead orchestration (where compatible with official format)
3. **Project-Specific Optimization** - ChatKit-focused agents, commands, and workflows
4. **Developer Experience** - Clearer examples, better discovery, faster iteration

Implementing these recommendations will transform an already strong foundation into a best-in-class Claude Code configuration that serves as both a productivity multiplier and a reference implementation for other projects.

**Note:** This document was corrected to remove incorrect XML-style recommendations and align fully with official Claude Code documentation.
